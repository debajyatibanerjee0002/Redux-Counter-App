# About the project

This is a simple COUNTER app using react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit, redux-thunk. In this projrct, I covered the steps to set up Redux Toolkit and Redux Thunk. Inspired by the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture, we separated the different application layers: presentation layer, data layer, and business logic layer. Additionally, we added LOADING and FULFILLMENT states to each action, allowing you to handle asynchronous actions and provide feedback to the user.
